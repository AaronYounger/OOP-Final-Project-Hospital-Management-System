# Hospital Management System Overview

Hospitals can struggle with managing patient information and scheduling information due to outdated systems. These outdated systems can lead to inefficiencies such as longer waiting times, scheduling errors, and a confusing billing process. If patients feel they do not have control over their medical information or how their healthcare is done, the process will become overwhelming and lead to fear and unnecessary stress. For this hospital management system, a system will be developed that gives patients more control and information over health information, appointment scheduling, and billing. Key features of this hospital management system will include collecting patient information and symptoms, recommending specialists based off their symptoms, displaying unique doctoral availability for patient selection, and supporting an automated billing process. Integrating this hospital management system will look to improve patient hospital operations and patient satisfaction.
